Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of osimertinib in this patient population and clinical trials of other third-generation EGFR TKI are currently under way. Additional challenges in this patient population, such as the upfront efficacy of osimertinib, validation of T790M in liquid biopsies as a dynamic predictive marker of efficacy, along with combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors are being explored, representing an extraordinary time of development for EGFR-mutant NSCLC.",

Inhibitors that target the kinase domain of EGFR have been developed and are clinically active.
