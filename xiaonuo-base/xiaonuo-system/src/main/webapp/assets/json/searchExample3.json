Additional challenges in this patient population, such as the upfront efficacy of osimertinib, validation of T790M in liquid biopsies as a dynamic predictive marker of efficacy, along with combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors are being explored, representing an extraordinary time of development for EGFR-mutant NSCLC."
