The Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) grading system (Grade 0: no perfusion; Grade 1: penetration with minimal perfusion; Grade 2a: partial filling 2/3 of the entire vascular territory; Grade 2b: complete filling, but the filling is slower than normal; Grade 3: complete perfusion) was used to assess the success or failure of recanalization. Successful recanalization was defined as TICI >=2a. Hemorrhagic transformations were assessed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging at 24+-4 hours after thrombolysis, or whenever clinical deterioration was suspected. Symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation was defined as any increase in the NIHSS score that could be attributed to intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) on brain imaging studies.

The median age for patients who received repeated thrombolytic therapy was 71 years old, and 4 patients were female. The median time interval between the first and second thrombolytic treatment was 16 months (ranging from 6 days to 76 months).
