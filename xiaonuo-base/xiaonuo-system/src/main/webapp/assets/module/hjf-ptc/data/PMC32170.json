Several studies have suggested that human papillomavirus (HPV) initiates and causes endogenous genetic alterations in the progression of CC. First, epidemiological studies have shown that most human CCs harbor the \"high risk\" HPV types 16, 18, 31 and 33. Second, some HPV proteins such as E6 and E7 interact with human tumor suppresser gene products and change cellular phenotypes. Finally, the integration linearizes HPV DNA between E1 and L1 genes and disrupts the viral E2 gene, which consequently induces expression of E6 and E7 genes. This genomic rearrangement is thought to be critical for the transformation and proliferation of the early precursors to these cancers. From a diagnostic viewpoint, the consistent presence of HPV in CC allows the viral DNA to be used as a genetic marker. For example, cervical pre-malignant lesions can be screened for highly sensitive HPV DNA detection technology in cell scrapings.",

					"text": "For analysis of the HPV DNA in the plasma from CC patients, HPV E6 gene amplification was performed using a protocol previously described with some modifications. The PCR reaction was in a total volume of 20 mul containing 200 muM of each dNTP, 10 muM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mM potassium chloride, 4.0 mM magnesium chloride, 0.5 units of AmpliTaq Gold (Perkin Elmer Cetus), 0.4 muM of WD76 (CGGTTSAACCGAAAMCGG) and WD67 (WGCAWATGGAWWGCYGTCTC), 0.1 muM of WD66 (AGCATGCGGTATACTGTCTC), WD 72 (CGGTCGGGACCGAAAACGG) and WD154 (TCCGTGTGGTGTGTCGTCCC). Additionally, another PCR using 0.3 muM of primers specific for ZP3, a gene on the human X chromosome, were performed to test the quality of DNA. For testing DNA and screening for HPV incidence, one ZP3 primer, and WD72 and WD76, respectively, were end labelled at 37 C for 1-2 h in a total volume of 10 mul containing 10 muM primer, 0.025 mCi [gamma-32P] ATP (Amersham-Pharmacia) at 3000 Ci mmol-1,10 mM magnesium chloride, 5 mM DTT, 70 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Without further separating of the unincorporated nucleotides, the kinase reaction was added to the PCR buffer mix. The PCR amplifications were performed as follows: initial denaturation at 95 C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 C for 1 min, annealing at 55 C for 1 min, extension at 72 C for 2 min and a final extension at 72 C for 7 min. Reaction products were mixed with loading buffer and loaded onto a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. DNA fragments were size fractionated at 800 V until the tracking dye had covered the appropriate distance of the gel. After electrophoresis, the wet gel was transferred to filter paper (Whatman), wrapped with Saran wrap and exposed to a phosphorus screen; the bands were visualized on PhosphoImager using ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics). E6 and ZP3 primer pairs yielded 243 and 177 bp PCR products, respectively. For HPV typing, 50 mul of unlabeled PCR product was prepared for dot blot experiments. All HPV DNA positive plasma and some tumor DNA samples were measured semiquantitatively by performing duplex radiolabeled E6 and ZP3 primer PCR and repeating the above PCR reaction. The difference between viral and host genome copy numbers was calculated from the relative intensity of PCR bands by the imageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics).",

Interestingly, there was an association between plasma HPV DNA and metastasis. Three out of six plasma HPV DNA positive patients but none of the other patients with HPV associated cancers had distant metastasis at the time of blood analysis (P < 0.001, RR = 15.67 (5.24<RR<46.83)). One of the three was stage IVB and two had a recurrence distant metastasis, one of whom had previously been plasma HPV DNA negative at stage IIIB. In addition, we evaluated the amount of HPV DNA in circulation by semi-quantitative PCR, comparing the intensity of PCR products between HPV E6 gene and ZP3, a gene on the human X chromosome. The average intensity ratio between these two bands from tumor DNA and plasma DNA samples was one and 0.08, respectively (Fig 1E and Table 2). Plasma from one of the patients, 106, was collected twice at different time and demonstrated the identical ratio (Fig 1E). Furthermore, the ratios from the three plasma samples of patients with metastases, 0.05, 0.14, and 0.19, was higher, though not statistically significant, p = 0.098, than from the other three non-metastasis patients, 0.02, 0.04, and 0.05. Interestingly, the three plasma HPV DNA positive patients who were stage IIB did not have as good a clinical outcome when compared with the other plasma HPV DNA negative patients with the same stage. Whereas 13 out of 14 plasma negative cases had a complete response to radiotherapy, 2 out of the 3 circulating viral DNA positive cases were partially resistant. However, formal comparison did not yet show significant statistical value, p = 0.063. In addition, we found that plasma HPV DNA positive patients may have tendency to develop recurrent disease.

In conjunction with the expression and high antibody titer of lytic replication genes in NPC patients, it is likely that some circulating EBV DNA in NPC is virion associated. In contrast to EBV, at least two lines of evidences indicated that plasma HPV DNA was free DNA, not virion-associated. First, the clinical phenotype associated with circulating DNA was similar between head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) and CC. A recent study used human promotor hypermethylation as a serum marker and demonstrated an association between this epigenetic marker and metastasis. In addition, circulating HPV DNA could be found in a low percentage and associate with metastasis not only of CC cases but also of HNSCC cases where the primary tumor harbors HPV DNA. The other reason that argues against the possibility that circulating HPV DNA is virion-associated is that the viral genome has integrated into the host genome with consequent deletion of part of the HPV genome.

					"text": "This study indicated that plasma HPV DNA was a specific, but not a sensitive, genetic marker for CC diagnosis. More importantly, there was a strong association between plasma HPV DNA and metastasis, both when considering incidence and amount of the circulating viral DNA. Plasma HPV DNA positive non-metastatic CC patients had tendency toward poor clinical outcome and development of recurrent distant metastasis. This was not surprising. Although a variety of studies have shown that patients with very early stage disease can harbor free circulating tumor DNA, several reports have revealed plasma tumor DNA to be more commonly detectable in advanced stage disease, to correlate inversely with clinical outcome and to correlate with a tendency to fail with effective treatment. There were at least three possible explanations for the association between plasma CC DNA and metastasis. The most common hypothesis is that circulating cancer DNA due to the lysis of circulating cancer cells or micrometastasis shed by the tumor. HPV-specific mRNA has been found in peripheral blood cells, circulating micrometastatic CC cells, and lymph nodes of advanced-stage CC patients with metastasis. Nevertheless, a study of the relative amount of DNA in the plasma of pancreatic cancer patients indicated that a number of circulating cancer cells was insufficient and rejected this hypothesis. Second, some in vitro and vivo studies have suggested that circulating tumor DNA in plasma might play a role in metastasis because of its high transforming activity. Finally, because there is a tendency toward poor clinical outcome for plasma HPV DNA positive CC patients, the mechanism to actively release tumor DNA into circulation might occur late during the multistep process of CC development when metastasis is more likely. Regardless of the mechanisms, our data show that plasma HPV DNA in viral associated CC should be an independent genetic marker to predict disease progression and clinical outcome.",
